# StickyNote
A simple yet fun way to organize tasks, inspired by the to-do lists you may put on your fridge!

Many of us may have grown up seeing fridge magnets and other decorations posted on our refrigerators. Growing up, I also had a to-do list on a post-it note on our fridge. Whether it was for groceries, chores, or cooking, there would always be some note held up by a magnet with tasks.

This inspired me to create StickyNote, a simple yet fun way to organize and decorate a personal space while keeping track of tasks! Set and complete tasks to earn reward points which you can use to customize the browser space.

So far I have only implemented basic features such as adding/completing tasks and a points counter, along with basic random customization. In the future, I plan to add more to the rewards system with things such as stickers, or fridge magnets!

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM (Document Object Model).
